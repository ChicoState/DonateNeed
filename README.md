DonateNeed is a platform for organizations to request specific donations for the intent of reducing waste of donations that are not needed. The website provides an easy way for users to pledge donations, find locations of local organizations, view local and current news, and view activity of other users and their donations. Additionally, dashboards will be created to show what has been requested by organizations vs what has been donated in real time, as well as showing what users are requesting vs what the organizations are requesting and showing recommendations on what to donate by the type of disaster.

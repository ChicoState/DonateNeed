      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>When it comes to disaster relief, redundant donations have become an inordinate problem. Here at Donate Need, we aspire to better connect agencies to donators to get agencies the exact donations they need; nothing more, nothing less. Through our efforts we can aim for a more sustainable impact and better help those in need.</p>

         "We are not equipped to receive donations, as we are located in an office building and have very little space. That did not stop people of sending donations. We received a semi-truck full of water one day, which we do not have the capacity to handle. We received so many donations and continue to this day. We received thousands of dollars in gift cards for survivors, hygiene products, clothes, food, masks, books, furniture, etc.
         The amount of unnecessary stress, time, and effort that was put into donation management we were not equipped with is astounding."
